THE MAIN MOTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS TO CREATE A DATABASE AND MAKE A RESPONSIVE WEBSITE IN WHICH WE CAN PURCHASE THE PRODUCT AND DONE THE PAYMENT METHOD VIA CARD,COD ETC.WE CAN ALSO VISIT PRODUCT DETAIL AND PURCHASE THE PRODUCT
Starting off i have made my project that is based on a dynamic website .  A dynamic website or dynamic web page contains information that changes, depending on the viewer, the time of the day, the time zone, the viewer's native language, and other factors. For example, the Computer Hope home page is a dynamic web page that automatically changes daily to give visitors new content  first come the backend 
For making this website the programming language we opt for is python.


Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale

Along with this the web framework that is used in this website is Django. Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model–template–views (MTV) architectural pattern.
Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models. 
Now we come at front end. 
For structuring this particular website we have used HTML 5. It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages.
 And for the most important but the most noticable thing that is beautification and styling of the website we chose the language CSS  that  describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. And also bootstrap that works for It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
